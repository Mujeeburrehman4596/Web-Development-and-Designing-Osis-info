            <h2>About Nelson Mandela</h2>
            <p>
                Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. 
                He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. Mandela's presidency marked the end of decades of racial discrimination, where he led a peaceful transition from apartheid to a democratic South Africa.

                Mandela is widely regarded as an icon of peace and justice. His tireless efforts to promote human rights and equality have inspired millions across the globe. He spent 27 years in prison for his activism, emerging as a leader committed to reconciliation.
